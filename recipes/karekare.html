    <p><em>A Filipino stew that features a thick savory peanut sauce with a base of stewed oxtail, beef tripe, pork hocks, calves' feet, pig's feet or trotters, various cuts of pork, beef stew meat, and occasionally offal</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds beef oxtail, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, quartered</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 large eggplant, cut into 2-inch chunks</li>
        <li>½ head bok choy, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>½ pound fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>¼ cup peanut butter, or as needed to thicken sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>STEPS</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large saucepan with water; add oxtail, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 2 hours over medium-low heat, skimming off the foam occasionally, until oxtail meat is very tender and broth is reduced to 3 cups.</li>
        <li>Stir in eggplant, bok choy, and green beans; simmer for about 20 minutes, until vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Just before serving, place peanut butter in a small bowl and thin with 1 or 2 tablespoons of broth. Stir until smooth and add to stew.</li>
